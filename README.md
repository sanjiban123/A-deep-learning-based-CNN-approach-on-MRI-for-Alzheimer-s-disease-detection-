# Project Title :   A deep learning based CNN approach on MRI for Alzheimer's disease detection

This is a final year project carried out  by Raghav Sikaria & Aarti Susane under the guidancce of Dr. Sanjiban Sekhar Roy, Associate Professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology in the year 2018.
# About the project : 
Alzheimer’s disease is a brain disorder which causes the malfunction of neurons. This disease can cause loss of brain function and dementia which can further damage memory, thought process and human behaviour. Regardless of being a worst disease, it has no cure. Only a handful of classification strategies have been proposed in the literature that too with a small set of training images. Existing methods for the detection of Alzheimer’s disease from MRI images make use of only certain selective subsets of data based on age, gender etc., and often rely on clinical data to aid in their classification. This work proposes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognition and detection of Alzheimer’s disease from MRI images, trained on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. CNNs are the most popular deep learning architectures used for image related problems in recent times. In addition to that, CNNs are also robust for classification that can eliminate the need to ignore certain subsets of data, and solely focus on the image data. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 80% and can be expected to achieve even higher accuracy with a substantial increase in the amount of data provided for training. We have incorporated Keras library in the python environment for building the proposed CNN.

 Keras implementation of  CNN under deep learning framework : 
As, keras is one of the popular packages available for deep learning implementation, we have adopted Keras framework. We chose the cross-sectional data as it is reported to be of more relevance and backed by a plethora of authors in this field. Primarily, it simply has more than double the data than the longitudinal MRI data - and since our algorithm gives data quantity the highest priority, we were compelled to opt for cross-sectional data.
